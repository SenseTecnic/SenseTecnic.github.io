# Settings

The settings pane allows you to configure Node-RED gateway settings.  Currently this includes:

### Node-RED Directory
This is where Node-RED stores flows and installed nodes.  By default these are stored in the `~/.fred-directory/node-red`

### Node-RED Port
The port that Node-RED runs on.

### Console logging level
Change the logging level for Node-RED as shown in the UI.  Normally this should be at `info` but may be changed to `debug` for more verbose Node-RED log output.

### Secure Editor
Click this checkbox to secure the Node-RED editor with a username and password.

### Save and Reset
If you change any settings, you will need to _Save_ them, and then restart the gateway for the settings to take effect.
Clicking on _Reset_ resets the settings to factory defaults.  To take effect, the gateway application needs to be restarted.

### Additional Settings
If there are any other Node-RED settings you would like to configure here, [please send us feedback](mailto:info@sensetecnic.com).
