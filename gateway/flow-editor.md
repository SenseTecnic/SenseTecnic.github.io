# Flow Editor

The Flow Editor pane displays the Node-RED editor and a console pane below.  You can edit your flows here.  Note that you will need to
enter a name and password to unlock the editor if you have set a password in the [settings](/gateway/settings).

Note that gateway also exposes the Node-RED editor on the local machine port 1880 by default, so that you can access the editor from a
standard browser by accessing [http://localhost:1880/red](http://localhost:1880/red).

## Installing Nodes

To install nodes, click on _Manage Palette_ from the Node-RED editor menu (top right), and then select the install tab in the palette. You can now search for new nodes to install, update, and enable and disable existing nodes.  For more information see the Node-RED documentation on [Adding Nodes](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/adding-nodes).
