# Main Window

The Gateway main window consists of a navigation bar and main pane:

- **[Flow Editor](/gateway/flow-editor)** - Node-RED edit pane and console display that appears on startup.
- **Dashboard** - Node-RED Dashboard ui node display.  Note that if you have no dashboard nodes in your flows, this will appear empty.
- **[Flow Wizards](/gateway/wizards)** - show list of available flow wizards to get you started creating flows.
- **[Settings](/gateway/settings)** - Gateway settings configuration.
- **Documentation** - display this documentation.
- **Contact** - how to contact Sense Tecnic for support

You can collapse the navigation pane by clicking on the arrows in the bottom right of the sidebar.

## Version

The FRED Gateway is strongly dependent on Node-RED and so displays two version numbers in the bottom left of the main window.  The first version number is the FRED Gateway Version, the second is the Node RED version it depends on.

> **Note:** When either Gateway or Node-RED functionality or fixes are made the Gateway version will be bumped.
