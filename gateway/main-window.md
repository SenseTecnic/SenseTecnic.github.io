## Version

The FRED Gateway is strongly dependent on Node-RED and so displays two version numbers in the bottom left of the main window.  The first version number is the FRED Gateway Version, the second is the Node RED version it depends on.

> **Note:** When either Gateway or Node-RED functionality or fixes are made the Gateway version will be bumped up.
