# Sharing your Node-RED Dashboard

If you are subscribed to the [FRED Tall](https://users.sensetecnic.com/subscriptions?return=https://fred.sensetecnic.com) plan, you can enable public access to your Node-RED UI dashboard.

To do so, simply:

1. Log in to your FRED instance.

2. Make sure the instance is started, node-red-dashboard node is installed and used in your flow.

3. Click the "Enable Public Dashboard" check box on the sidebar.

4. Your dashboard can now be accessed at "https://fred.sensetecnic.com/public/\<YOUR_USERNAME\>/ui/" without logging in to your FRED instance.

5. To disable sharing, simply uncheck the checkbox.
