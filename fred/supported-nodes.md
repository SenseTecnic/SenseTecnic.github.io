Because FRED is a cloud-hosted service, it does not make sense to include nodes that access hardware or the underlying operating system.  The following core nodes are *disabled* in FRED:

    '75-exec.js'
    '35-arduino.js'
    '36-rpi-gpio.js'
    '25-serial.js'
    '28-tail.js'
    '50-file.js'
    '23-watch.js'
