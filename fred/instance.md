# Your Node-RED Instance

If you are logged in, your full name entered during registration will appear in the top right of the FRED navigation bar. Under this pull down there are several options:

- **Node-RED** - link to your Node-RED administration user interface.  
- **Profile** - Brings up a modal dialog for you to edit your user profile.
- **Status** - this brings up a status window containing information about your Node-RED instance and a button to start and stop your Node-RED instance
- **Log out** - log out of FRED.

Note that if your instance of Node RED is not running currently, this option will be disabled. Once in Node-RED, you can go back to your FRED home page or logout of FRED using the menu under the User icon.

In this dialog, you can see the time the instance was last started, and received data, as well as view the last on your Node-RED output. There is a large button there allowing you to start and stop your instance. To refresh the contents of your Node-RED output, click on the refresh button.
