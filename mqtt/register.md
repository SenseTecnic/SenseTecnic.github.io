# Register and Log in.

If you are already a Sense Tecnic FRED user, there is no need to register for the STS MQTT service.  Just hit the [STS MQTT home page](https://mqtt.sensetecnic.com) and you're in! The MQTT service for FRED requires a paid account, so you may need to upgrade your account to use MQTT for FRED. 

If you are not a FRED user, you have to sign up for a FRED paid account to access the MQTT service. Follow this link to get started [Account Registration](https://users.sensetecnic.com/register)


You will be redirected to the Sense Tecnic [Account Registration](https://users.sensetecnic.com/register) page.

Fill out the form with your user name, first and last name, email address, password and other information and hit submit.  You will then be asked to validate your email address by email.

Once youâ€™re email address validated, [log in](https://users.sensetecnic.com/login?return=https://mqtt.sensetecnic.com/dash) to access the STS-MQTT dashboard.  Initially you will be shown the Status Tab described [next](/mqtt/status/).
