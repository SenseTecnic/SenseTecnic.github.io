# Information and Error Messages

When you first login to the STS-MQTT server, you will see the Status panel where Information and Error Messages are shown. These are useful tools to monitor the status and debug errors on the STS-MQTT server. Or you can switch to the Status panel by clicking the *Status* button on the side bar to view Information and Error Messages.
