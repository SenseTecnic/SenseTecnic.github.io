- **[Dashboard](/desktop/dashboard)** - Node-RED Dashboard ui node display.  Note that if you have no dashboard nodes in your flows, this will appear empty.
- **[Status](/desktop/status)** - manage persistent message storage in your MQTT connections.
- **[Cookbook](/desktop/cookbook)** - show list of available flow recipes to get you started creating flows.

You can collapse the navigation pane by clicking on the arrows in the bottom right of the sidebar.

## Version

The FRED Desktop is strongly dependent on Node-RED and so displays two version numbers in the bottom left of the main window.  The first version number is the FRED Desktop Version, the second is the Node RED version it depends on.

> **Note:** When either FRED Desktop or Node-RED functionality or fixes are made the Desktop version will be bumped.
