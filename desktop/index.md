# Introduction

The FRED Desktop is a Node-RED desktop distribution bundled with additional features for ease of use, setup and configuration, and full support from [Sense Tecnic Systems](http://sensetecnic.com).  For more information on the Node-RED system see [the documentation](https://nodered.org/docs).  Sense Tecnic also provides [the Node-RED Guide](http://noderedguide.com/) and a number of Node-RED tutorials on the [developer site](https://developers.sensetecnic.com).

## Why FRED Desktop?

Normally, to install Node-RED on a desktop OS like Windows, Mac OS and Linux, you will need to install Node.js, and then install and configure Node-RED on the command line.  The FRED Desktop uses the cross-platform [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) desktop application framework popularized by applications such as *Slack* and *Spotify*.  Using the FRED , you simply install the desktop application and double click on the icon to get started with Node-RED.
