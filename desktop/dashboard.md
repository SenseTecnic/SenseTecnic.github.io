# Dashboard

The Dashboard pane displays the Node-RED dashboard user interface generated using the Dashboard nodes included with FRED Desktop.  You can also open the dashboard in a browser by clicking on the external link icon beside *Dashboard* in the nav bar.  Note that if you have no dashboard nodes in your flows, this will appear empty.
