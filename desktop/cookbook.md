# Cookbook

When you click on the Cookbook you'll see a list of recipes to get you started creating Node-RED flows for your application.

Clicking on a recipe in the list will give you information on the flow that will be generated, and what information you will need to generate the flow successfully including suporting systems, URLs and other configuration parameters.

When you are ready to generate a flow, click on the _Play_ button.  This will bring up the recipe configuration window where you can fill in parameters step by step.

When ready you click on the _Done_ button.  This will deploy the newly generated flow to your Node-RED instance.  You will then be redirected to the Flow Editor where you can review and merge the newly installed flow with the editor view.

The new flow will be added to a new tab at the far right.  Using the Node-RED editor, you can then make modifications to this flow like any other and redeploy.
